## The 'RMAT' package

The RMAT package is developed for simulating various classes of common random matrices and their ensembles. Its primary functionality includes:

- Simulating various random matrices
- Simulating ensembles of these random matrices
- Visualizing the eigenvalue spectra of these matrix ensembles

The matrices included are:

- Normal Matrices
- Beta Ensemble for b = 1,2,4
- Generalized Beta Ensemble for b > 0
- Stochastic Matrices
- Stochastic Matrices with parameterized sparsity
- Band Matrices

For some matrices, there are included free parameters in the relevant functions:

- Real-valued/Complex valued entries
- Symmetric/Hermitian matrices
